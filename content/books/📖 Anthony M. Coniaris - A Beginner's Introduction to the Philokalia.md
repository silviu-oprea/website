Theology is searching for the beloved. It is about growing in intimacy with God. It involves all activities, including intellectual, flowing from, or leading to, intimacy with God. One cannot study Theology without seeking virtue and self denial.

Secular Theology is not a thing. That is some kind of weak philosophy.

Fr. Seraphim Rose on how not to approach the Fathers:
1. Dilintantism. Interested but not committed. Dabbler. No interest in conversion.
2. Doing Theology with a cigarette. Tendency of mixing the Sacred with the Frivolous. How can you involved in the study of the Fathers, yet still immersed in the things of the world, in the vices. Approaching these writings has to be done in the spirit of true conversion, looking to change our life.
3. Zeal not according to knowledge. One form is high idealism. Attracted to the deep prayer and solitude of desert Fathers, Silence. But no experiential knowledge though. No work that leads to understanding. Just fascinated with them. Enthusiastic. Desert Fathers become our idols. We become Fans of them.  Daydream about following them but not doing it.


- We should be teachable. Docility. Also humility. And desire to deepen our faith. Not just curiosity. Seek Theosis.

# Nepsis

"The glory of God is a human being who is fully alive" - St. Iranaeus

Nepsis is a state of being. In this state we are fully alive, meaning: awake, alert, vigilant (watchful), and attentive to God in the present moment.

"an aliveness present when you talk, read, watch or examine something." - St. Theophan the Recluse

Fully attentive to God in the present moment, watching the doorway to our heart.

Every thought that comes to mind: question, interogate, set aside, and redirect attention to the  simple remembrance of God.

- Completely present in the present moment, attentive to God. Every moment is filled with God. Profound opportunity to love or not to love. Refuse anything that leads into a false reality, away from loving God in the present moment.
